Automatically identify the subject of posts from a media platform using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

### Assembly language to machine assembler + simulator
*C*

Built a program that takes an assembly-language program and translate it into machine language, as well as a simulator that depicts the current state of registers and memory

### Cache Simulator
*C*

Built a program that simulates the cache.

### Adapting Graph Algorithms to 'Among Us' 
*C++*

Used various graph algorithms (minimum spanning tree, branch and bound) to create a program that simulates the game 'Among Us'

### Instagram Clone
